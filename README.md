# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview: 

In this project senario, I have a job as a data analyst for PyBer, a python based ride sharing app. First I had to perform an exploritory analysis on data in some large csv files. I had to create different visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. For this analysis I wrote python scripts using Panda's Library, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcased the relationship between the type of city, number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city.

That information that I found will now help me with this new assignment. Using my Python skills, I have been assked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I am to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. I will ultimately show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

This analysis will help PyBer improve access to the ride-sharing services and determine affordabilty for underdeserved neighbors.

## Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Summary: 
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview: 

In this project senario, I have a job as a data analyst for PyBer, a python based ride sharing app. First I had to perform an exploritory analysis on data in some large csv files. I had to create different visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. For this analysis I wrote python scripts using Panda's Library, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcased the relationship between the type of city, number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city.

That information that I found will now help me with this new assignment. Using my Python skills, I have been assked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I am to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. I will ultimately show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

This analysis will help PyBer improve access to the ride-sharing services and determine affordabilty for underdeserved neighbors.

## Results: 
* Rural cities had the least amount of drivers (78), rides (125)	and total fares ($4,327.93).
* Urban cities had the most amount of drivers (2405), rides (1625) and total fares ($39,854.38).
* Suburban cities were in the middle having the 2nd most drivers (490), rides (625) and total fares ($19,356.33).

* Rural cities havd the highest average fare per ride ($34.62) and fare per driver ($55.49).
* Urban cities had the lowest average of fare per ride ($24.53) and fare per driver ($16.57).

## Summary: 
Based on the results, I would reccomend at least 3 of my ideas to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Make sure the drivers are assigned to the city type they tipically work in or live near.
2. In Urban cities, the prices need to be upped  per mile because the trips are usually shorter and the drivers won't recieve as high of a tip (due to the distance).
3. In Rural cities, the prices should be decreased per mile because of the opposite reason for Urban cities to up the prices. Rural cities tend to have longer rides, and to make it more affordable for someone to tip higher and use the app for longer distances, the price per mile should decrease. This could be a great solution to increase the amount of rides.
4. Depending on how many riders there are in the city during certain months, make charge increases or decreases.
